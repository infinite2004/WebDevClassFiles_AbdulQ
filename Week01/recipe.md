# Ingredients:
- 1 Â½ cups (190g) all-purpose flour
- 3 Â½ teaspoons (15g) baking powder
- 1 teaspoon (5g) salt
- 1 tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar
- 1 Â¼ cups (300ml) milk
- 1 egg
- 3 tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter, melted

# Instructions:
1. Mix Dry Ingredients:
    - In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
2. Combine Wet Ingredients:
    - In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, egg, and melted butter until well blended.
3. Mix Wet and Dry:
    - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmixâ€”itâ€™s okay if there are some lumps.
4. Preheat Pan:
    - Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease it with butter or cooking spray.
5. Cook Pancakes:
    1. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.
    2. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set (about 2 minutes).
    3. Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown.
6. Serve:
    - Stack the pancakes and serve warm with your favorite toppings: syrup, butter, fruit, or whipped cream!

# Tips:
- For fluffier pancakes, let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking.
- Adjust the heat as needed to prevent burning.
- Add mix-ins like chocolate chips or blueberries for extra flavor.

# Enjoy your pancakes! ðŸ¥ž
